# Specification Quality Checklist: Google Drive Image URL Transformation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items have been validated and pass:

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ The specification focuses on "what" and "why" without prescribing technical implementation
- ✅ All language is accessible to business stakeholders
- ✅ User-focused terminology used throughout
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ All 8 functional requirements are clearly stated and testable
- ✅ No clarification markers present - all requirements are unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "100% of exhibitions", "no more than 50ms")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific functions, libraries, or code)
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Five edge cases identified covering access permissions, URL formats, availability, and error conditions
- ✅ "Out of Scope" section clearly defines boundaries
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions sections provide necessary context

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User stories cover the full journey from normal operation (P1) to performance (P2) to error handling (P3)
- ✅ Success criteria are independently verifiable without knowing implementation
- ✅ No leakage of technical implementation details

## Notes

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. The feature addresses a clear user need (broken images) with well-defined requirements and measurable success criteria. All assumptions about Google Drive URL formats and access permissions are documented, and edge cases are identified for consideration during implementation.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan.
