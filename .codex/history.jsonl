Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 5 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       * A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       * A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n   - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n   - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n   - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n   - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n   - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions render options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> | (add D/E as needed up to 5)\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) | (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate)\n\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options), output a single line after the question: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words)`.\n    - After the user answers:\n       * Validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       * If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       * Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       * All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       * User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       * You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       * Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       * Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       * Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       * User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       * Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       * Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       * Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       * Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/plan` or run `/clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n - If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n - If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}

Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 5 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       * A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       * A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n   - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n   - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n   - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n   - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n   - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions render options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> | (add D/E as needed up to 5)\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) | (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate)\n\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options), output a single line after the question: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words)`.\n    - After the user answers:\n       * Validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       * If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       * Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       * All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       * User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       * You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       * Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       * Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       * Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       * User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       * Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       * Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       * Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       * Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/plan` or run `/clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n - If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n - If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}
